## How it Works

The TradeighT indicator uses the `OnCalculate` function to analyze the price changes in the market. It calculates the price change between the current price and the previous price. If the price change is positive, it generates a buy signal. If the price change is negative, it generates a sell signal. If there is no price change, no trade signal is generated.

The `ExecuteTrade` function is responsible for executing the trades based on the generated signals. It checks the trade type (buy or sell) and performs the corresponding trade execution.

The indicator also includes various custom functions to enhance user experience, test and debug the code, handle large volumes of data for analysis, adhere to coding standards, provide support and maintenance, comply with legal and ethical requirements, document the code, collaborate with the TradeighT team, and gather requirements and provide updates.
